# Features-Affecting-Airbnb-Price
Analyzed and cleaned data from Inside Airbnb using Python in a 2-member team to create an 8 page report
discussing how the features of an Airbnb affect its popularity and price in Edinburgh.
Conducted hypothesis testing using right-tailed two sample t-tests to check if certain amenities of a listing increased
its price. Found p values to be less than 0.05 and hence rejected the null hypothesis of amenities not affecting the
price.
Ran different machine learning models like linear regression, random forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours on the
cleaned data. Highest R
2 value of 0.6 was scored by the random forest model.
